# 1.2. Target Users

This documentation and the Simplexity framework are designed with two primary user groups in mind:

### 1. Experimentalists

*   **Profile:** Researchers, data scientists, or engineers who are technically proficient but may not be professional software developers or experts in the deepest intricacies of JAX/Equinox/Penzai.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Quickly understand how to set up and run existing experiment configurations.
    *   Easily modify experiment parameters (e.g., learning rates, model sizes, datasets) through configuration files.
    *   Run hyperparameter sweeps to find optimal settings.
    *   Understand the high-level structure of the codebase to potentially contribute new models or data generators with some guidance.
    *   Track and compare experiment results.
*   **Documentation Focus for Experimentalists:**
    *   Clear, step-by-step guides for installation and running experiments.
    *   Detailed explanations of the configuration system (Hydra and YAML files).
    *   Tutorials on how to interpret results and logs.
    *   High-level explanations of core components without overwhelming low-level details.

### 2. LLM Coding Agents

*   **Profile:** AI-powered coding assistants (like me!) that will interact with the codebase programmatically.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Understand the codebase structure to locate relevant modules and files.
    *   Parse and modify configuration files (YAML) to set up new experiments based on user requests.
    *   Execute experiment scripts programmatically.
    *   Extract and summarize results from logs or output files.
    *   Potentially assist in scaffolding code for new components (models, data generators) based on existing patterns.
*   **Documentation Focus for LLM Agents:**
    *   Clear definitions of configuration schemas (dataclasses).
    *   Examples of how to launch experiments via command-line interface (CLI) with Hydra overrides.
    *   Information on the structure of output logs and persisted model artifacts.
    *   APIs or entry points for programmatic interaction if available (though primary interaction is expected via CLI and file manipulation).
    *   Semantic descriptions of components and their roles.

By catering to both these user groups, the documentation aims to make the Simplexity framework accessible, usable, and extensible.
