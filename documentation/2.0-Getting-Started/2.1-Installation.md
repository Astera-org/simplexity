# 2.1. Installation

This guide describes how to set up your environment to run experiments with the Simplexity framework.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version 3.12 or higher is required. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Poetry or a similar Python packaging and dependency management tool (Recommended):** While not strictly required, using a tool like Poetry or Hatch (as indicated by `hatchling` in `pyproject.toml`) can simplify managing dependencies and virtual environments. For this guide, we'll assume a general approach using `pip`.
*   **(Optional) NVIDIA GPU and CUDA:** If you plan to train models on an NVIDIA GPU, you will need to have the appropriate NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installed. The JAX dependency is specified as `jax[cuda12_pip]`, indicating compatibility with CUDA 12.

## Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd simplexity # Or your project's root directory
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management. You can install the core dependencies using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -e . 
    ```
    This command installs the package in editable mode (`-e`) along with its dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

    If you only need to run experiments and not develop the core framework, you might just install the package directly:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

4.  **Install JAX with GPU support (if applicable):**
    The `jax[cuda12_pip]` dependency attempts to install JAX with CUDA 12 support. Ensure your CUDA environment is correctly set up. If you encounter issues or have a different CUDA version, refer to the official JAX installation guide: [https://github.com/google/jax#installation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for instructions on installing JAX with the correct CUDA/ROCm drivers.

5.  **Verify Installation (Optional but Recommended):**
    Although there isn't a specific command here to verify, a good check would be to try running a basic experiment (once you understand how to do that from the subsequent documentation sections) or to run the test suite if available (see development dependencies for tools like `pytest`).

## Development Dependencies

If you plan to contribute to the development of the framework, you might want to install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This will install tools like `pytest` for testing, `ruff` for linting, and `pyright` for type checking.

## Next Steps

Once the installation is complete, you can proceed to understand the [Core Concepts](./core_concepts.md) of the framework.
