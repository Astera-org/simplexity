# Factored Generator Implementation - PR Review Report

## Task for Reviewer
**Please thoroughly review this factored generator implementation for:**

1. **Code Quality & Architecture** - Assess design decisions, adherence to existing patterns, and overall implementation quality
2. **Mathematical Correctness** - Verify the outer product token generation, probability calculations, and independence assumptions
3. **Performance Considerations** - Evaluate JAX optimization, computational complexity, and scalability
4. **Integration Soundness** - Check compatibility with existing training/evaluation infrastructure
5. **Research Utility** - Assess whether this enables meaningful compositional modeling experiments
6. **Testing Coverage** - Review whether the testing strategy adequately covers edge cases and integration points

**Approval Criteria**: This should work seamlessly as a drop-in replacement for existing generators while enabling new research capabilities. Focus on correctness, performance, and maintainability.

## Overview
This PR implements a factored generative process that combines multiple independent HMMs/GHMMs using outer product token generation. The implementation provides a complete drop-in replacement for existing single generators while enabling compositional modeling capabilities for research applications.

## Key Design Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Outer Product Token Combination Strategy
**Implementation**: Factor sequences → tuples → composite tokens via bijective mapping
```python
# factor1=[0,1,1,0] + factor2=[3,2,1,2] → [(0,3),(1,2),(1,1),(0,2)] → [A,B,C,D]
def _tuple_to_token(self, token_tuple: tuple[jax.Array, ...]) -> jax.Array:
    token = jnp.array(0)
    multiplier = jnp.array(1)
    for i in reversed(range(len(token_tuple))):
        token += token_tuple[i] * multiplier
        multiplier *= self.components[i].vocab_size
    return token
```

**Rationale**: Base conversion ensures bijective mapping while maintaining deterministic token ordering. Vocab size scales as ∏(component_vocab_sizes), enabling interpretable factorization.

### 2. Independent Belief State Tracking
**Implementation**: `FactoredState = tuple[jax.Array, ...]`
```python
@property
def initial_state(self) -> FactoredState:
    return tuple(component.initial_state for component in self.components)

def transition_states(self, state: FactoredState, obs: chex.Array) -> FactoredState:
    component_obs_tuple = self._token_to_tuple(obs)
    new_component_states = []
    for component, component_state, component_obs in zip(self.components, state, component_obs_tuple, strict=True):
        new_state = component.transition_states(component_state, component_obs)
        new_component_states.append(new_state)
    return tuple(new_component_states)
```

**Rationale**: Avoids exponential state space growth while maintaining mathematical independence. Each component evolves based only on its portion of the composite observation.

### 3. Mathematical Correctness
**Probability Decomposition**:
```python
def probability(self, observations: jax.Array) -> jax.Array:
    # Extract component sequences from composite observations
    component_sequences = []
    for i in range(len(self.components)):
        component_seq = []
        for obs in observations:
            component_tokens = self._token_to_tuple(obs)
            component_seq.append(component_tokens[i])
        component_sequences.append(jnp.array(component_seq))
    
    # P(composite_sequence) = ∏ P(component_sequence_i)
    total_prob = jnp.array(1.0)
    for component, component_seq in zip(self.components, component_sequences, strict=True):
        component_prob = component.probability(component_seq)
        total_prob *= component_prob
    return total_prob
```

**Rationale**: Exploits independence assumption for computational efficiency while maintaining probabilistic correctness.
