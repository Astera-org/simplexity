# Unified API: Independent Structure
# Independent structure has no conditional dependencies:
# Each factor operates independently, always using variant 0.
# Joint distribution is simply the product of independent factor distributions.

# Example interpretation:
# - Each factor operates completely independently
# - Factor 0 always emits from mess3(x=0.15, a=0.6)
# - Factor 1 always emits from mess3(x=0.5, a=0.6)
# - Factor 2 always emits from mess3(x=0.2, a=0.7)
# - Joint distribution: P(t0,t1,t2) = P(t0) * P(t1) * P(t2)
# - No control maps needed - factors don't depend on each other
